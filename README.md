## Features

- **Interactive CLI**: Prompt the user to input the duration for the countdown.
- **Real-time Countdown**: Display the remaining time in seconds.
- **Styled Output**: Use colors and bold text to enhance readability.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Inquirer**: A collection of common interactive command-line user interfaces.
- **Chalk**: Terminal string styling done right.
